# 104 Spark MovieLens

The goal of this lab is to run some analysis on a different dataset, [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), on AWS.

- Notebook environment [here](../src/main/python/lab104/104-spark-movielens.ipynb).
- Scala program [here](../src/main/scala/lab104/MovieLens.scala).

Summary of the lab:

- Discussion of 104 slides about cluster configuration
- Download MovieLens dataset (see notebook)
- Local test of 104-2 in the notebook, setting cluster configuration parameters in local `conf/spark-defaults.conf` file
- Cluster creation on AWS
- Setting credentials and building JAR for Scala program
- Spark-submit of 104-2 on the cluster
- Job analysis on remote History server
- Individual implementation of 104-3

AWS CLI commands to create the cluster (note: [m4.large](https://aws.amazon.com/it/ec2/instance-types/) machines have 2 cores and 8GB of RAM):

```bash
aws emr create-cluster \
    --name "Big Data Cluster" \
    --release-label "emr-7.3.0" \
    --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark \
    --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=6,InstanceType=m4.large \
    --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
    --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole,KeyName=<my_key_pair_name> \
    --region "us-east-1"
```

Check the [101-3 Readme](../readmes/101.md#101-3-working-with-spark) to see how to launch the Spark applications on the clusters.
In the configuration, you can click on `Additioanl customization` to add configuration parameters. In particular, consider:
- `Spark configuration` to choose between 'cluster' and 'client' deploy modes; in the former case, Spark's Driver will take resources away from the computing machines
- `Executor` to configure the resources requested for executors (number of executors, cores and memory for each executor)

To connect to the History Server in AWS
- Connect to AWS's WebUI
- Access the EMR service
- Access the cluster
- Click on the Applications tab
- Click on "User interface of Spark History Server"
- Since the server is *very slow* consider downloading the report of the application and navigating it locally by launching the local history server (see [101-extra](../readmes/101.md#101-extra-configuring-your-own-computer))
